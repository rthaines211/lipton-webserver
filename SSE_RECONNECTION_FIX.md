# SSE Infinite Reconnection Loop Fix

## Problem
The SSE (Server-Sent Events) client was stuck in an infinite reconnection loop after job completion:
1. Job completes successfully
2. SSE connection closes
3. Browser's EventSource triggers an `onerror` event
4. Connection automatically reopens
5. Receives same "complete" message again
6. Loop repeats indefinitely

## Root Cause
The browser's native EventSource API has built-in automatic reconnection logic. Even though the code was checking if the job was completed (`jobCompleted` flag), it wasn't **actively closing** the EventSource connection when errors occurred on completed jobs. This allowed the browser to keep attempting reconnections.

## Solution Applied

### Changes to `js/sse-client.js`:

1. **Enhanced `onerror` handler** (lines 110-124):
   - When job is completed/destroyed, **forcibly close** the EventSource instead of just returning
   - Prevents browser from auto-reconnecting

2. **Enhanced `handleConnectionError` method** (lines 239-286):
   - Added explicit EventSource closure when job is completed/destroyed
   - Added `jobCompleted` check to the reconnection timeout

3. **Enhanced `handleCompleteEvent` method** (lines 167-198):
   - Set `jobCompleted = true` **immediately** at the start (before any other processing)
   - Clear silence detection timeout immediately
   - Added try-catch-finally to ensure connection closes even on parse errors

4. **Enhanced `handleErrorEvent` method** (lines 204-243):
   - Set `jobCompleted = true` immediately for server-side errors
   - Clear silence detection timeout
   - Added cleanup in error cases

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the updated code** to your GCP instance
2. **Submit a form** that triggers document generation
3. **Monitor the browser console** - you should see:
   ```
   âœ… SSE connection opened for [jobId]
   âœ… Job completed for [jobId]
   ðŸ”Œ Closing SSE connection for [jobId]
   ```
   - **No repeated connection attempts after completion**
   - **No "SSE error but job is completed" messages looping**

4. **Check notifications** - should only show ONE success notification, not multiple

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- âœ… Single connection per job
- âœ… Clean shutdown after completion
- âœ… No reconnection attempts after job completes
- âœ… Single success notification
- âœ… No console spam

## Files Modified

- `/js/sse-client.js` - Primary fix
- `/dist/js/sse-client.js` - Deployment copy (updated)

## No Changes Needed

- `js/sse-manager.js` - Already properly manages connections
- `js/form-submission.js` - Already properly cleans up old connections
- `js/progress-state.js` - Works correctly

## Deployment

The fixed `sse-client.js` has been copied to the `dist` folder. To deploy:

```bash
# If using a build process, rebuild:
npm run build  # (if applicable)

# Then deploy to GCP:
gcloud app deploy
# OR redeploy your Cloud Run service with the updated files
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can restore from:
- `js/sse-client.js.backup` (create a backup first if needed)
- Previous git commit
