# SSE Reconnection Loop - Phase 1 Fix Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

This Phase 1 fix addresses the SSE (Server-Sent Events) reconnection loop that occurs after job completion. While the primary ECONNREFUSED issue has been resolved, we observed that SSE connections were reconnecting 3-4 times after job completion, causing duplicate "Job completed" messages in the browser console.

---

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Why Phase 1 focuses on server-side fixes:**
- The reconnection loop is primarily caused by timing issues on the server
- Server continues to poll and send events after job completes
- This triggers the browser's automatic EventSource reconnection
- Fixing the server side first is safer and easier than client changes
- Server-side fixes prevent the problem at its source

## 🐛 Problem Analysis

### Observed Behavior (Before Fix):

```javascript
✅ Job completed for 1761224074513-nqtyrffet
🔌 Closing SSE connection
🆕 SSE connection opened  // ⬅️ UNWANTED RECONNECT #1
✅ Job completed for 1761224074513-nqtyrffet (duplicate)
🔌 Closing SSE connection
🆕 SSE connection opened  // ⬅️ UNWANTED RECONNECT #2
✅ Job completed for 1761224074513-nqtyrffet (duplicate)
// ... continues 2-4 times
```

### Root Causes Identified:

**Issue 1: Race Condition in Interval Cleanup**
- Server sends 'complete' event at T+0ms
- Server schedules connection close for T+1000ms (1 second delay)
- Polling interval fires again at T+2000ms (2 second interval)
- Interval sends another 'complete' event BEFORE connection closes
- This triggers client reconnection

**Issue 2: No State Tracking**
- Server doesn't track if 'complete' event already sent
- `sendProgress()` function can be called multiple times
- Each call checks status and sends event again
- No mechanism to prevent duplicate complete events

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1 Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1A: Immediate Interval Cleanup

**Change:** Clear intervals BEFORE scheduling connection close

```javascript
// Before:
if (status.status === 'success' || status.status === 'failed') {
    setTimeout(() => {
        res.end();
    }, 1000);  // ⬅️ Interval still running for 1 second
}

// After:
if (status.status === 'success' || status.status === 'failed') {
    completeSent = true;  // Mark as sent

    // ✅ Clear intervals IMMEDIATELY
    clearInterval(interval);
    clearInterval(heartbeat);

    // Then schedule close (reduced delay)
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (!res.writableEnded) {
            res.end();
        }
    }, 500);  // ⬅️ Reduced from 1000ms to 500ms
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents interval from firing additional updates
- Reduces window for race conditions
- Faster connection cleanup

---

### Fix 1B: Connection State Tracking

**Change:** Track whether complete/error event has been sent

```javascript
// Added at beginning of SSE endpoint:
app.get('/api/jobs/:jobId/stream', (req, res) => {
    const { jobId } = req.params;
    let completeSent = false;  // ⬅️ NEW: State tracking

    // ...

    const sendProgress = () => {
        // ✅ NEW: Skip if complete already sent
        if (completeSent) {
            return;
        }

        const status = getPipelineStatus(jobId);
        // ... rest of function
    };
```

**Benefits:**
- Guarantees only ONE complete/error event per connection
- Prevents duplicate events even if interval fires
- Simple boolean flag for state management

---

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Why both fixes are needed together:**
- Fix 1A prevents the interval from running after completion
- Fix 1B provides a safety net if interval somehow fires anyway
- This defense-in-depth approach ensures reliability
- The combination addresses both timing and logic issues
- Together they create a robust solution

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Phase 1 Fix:

```javascript
✅ SSE connection opened for xxx
📊 Progress: 0/4 → 2/4 → 3/4 → 4/4
✅ Job completed for xxx  // 1st time
🔌 Closing SSE connection
🆕 SSE connection opened   // ⬅️ UNWANTED
✅ Job completed for xxx  // 2nd time (duplicate) ⬅️ UNWANTED
🔌 Closing SSE connection
🆕 SSE connection opened   // ⬅️ UNWANTED
✅ Job completed for xxx  // 3rd time (duplicate) ⬅️ UNWANTED
🔌 Closing SSE connection
```

### After Phase 1 Fix (Expected):

```javascript
✅ SSE connection opened for xxx
📊 Progress: 0/4 → 2/4 → 3/4 → 4/4
✅ Job completed for xxx  // ONE TIME ONLY
🔌 Closing SSE connection
// END - No more reconnections ✅
```

---

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**How to verify the fix is working:**
- Count the "Job completed" messages - should be exactly 1
- Look for "SSE connection opened" after completion - should NOT appear
- Check for "SSE error but job is completed" - should NOT appear
- The key indicator is a clean, single completion without reconnection attempts
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment Script Fails

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ Failed to apply fixes
ERROR: Could not find SSE endpoint pattern
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify server.js exists at expected path
2. Check that SSE endpoint hasn't been modified significantly
3. Review backup file to see original state
4. Contact support if endpoint signature has changed

---

### Issue: Reconnections Still Occur

**Symptoms:** Still seeing 2-4 "Job completed" messages

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Browser cache:** Old JavaScript still loaded
2. **Client-side issues:** May need Phase 2 (client-side) fixes
3. **Deployment not active:** New revision not serving traffic yet

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Clear Browser Cache**
```bash
# Chrome/Edge
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Windows)

# Firefox
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+F5 (Windows)
```

**Solution 2: Verify Deployment**
```bash
gcloud run services describe node-server \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --format='value(status.latestReadyRevisionName)'
```

Check that the revision timestamp is recent (after your deployment).

**Solution 3: Check Logs**
```bash
gcloud run services logs tail node-server --region=us-central1
```

Submit a form and watch for patterns showing if fix is active.

**Solution 4: Implement Phase 2**

If Phase 1 doesn't fully resolve the issue, client-side fixes (Phase 2) may also be needed.

---

### Issue: Service Returns 500 Errors

**Symptoms:** Forms fail to submit, 500 errors in logs

**This indicates a syntax error in the fix.**

**Immediate Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Find your backup
ls -lt "/Users/ryanhaines/Desktop/Lipton Webserver/backups/"

# 2. Restore backup (use most recent)
cp "/Users/ryanhaines/Desktop/Lipton Webserver/backups/server.js.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS" \
   "/Users/ryanhaines/Desktop/Lipton Webserver/server.js"

# 3. Redeploy
cd "/Users/ryanhaines/Desktop/Lipton Webserver"
gcloud run deploy node-server --source . --region=us-central1
```

---

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (Using Backup):

```bash
# 1. List available backups
ls -lt "/Users/ryanhaines/Desktop/Lipton Webserver/backups/"

# 2. Restore desired backup
cp "/Users/ryanhaines/Desktop/Lipton Webserver/backups/server.js.backup-20251023-130000" \
   "/Users/ryanhaines/Desktop/Lipton Webserver/server.js"

# 3. Redeploy original version
cd "/Users/ryanhaines/Desktop/Lipton Webserver"
gcloud run deploy node-server --source . --region=us-central1
```

---

### Cloud Run Revision Rollback:

If you need to rollback to a previous Cloud Run revision without redeploying:

```bash
# 1. List recent revisions
gcloud run revisions list \
  --service=node-server \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --limit=5

# 2. Rollback to specific revision
gcloud run services update-traffic node-server \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --to-revisions=node-server-00027-gc9=100
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Real-Time Log Monitoring

While testing, keep logs open in a separate terminal:

```bash
gcloud run services logs tail node-server --region=us-central1
```

### Search for Specific Patterns

**Check for completion events:**
```bash
gcloud run services logs read node-server \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --limit=50 | grep "complete"
```

**Check for reconnection patterns:**
```bash
gcloud run services logs read node-server \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --limit=50 | grep "SSE connection"
```

**Check for errors:**
```bash
gcloud run services logs read node-server \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --limit=50 | grep -i "error"
```

---

## 🚦 Next Steps

### If Phase 1 Resolves the Issue:

✅ **No further action needed!**

The SSE reconnection loop should be completely resolved.

---

### If Reconnections Still Occur:

Consider implementing **Phase 2 (Client-Side Fixes)**:

**Phase 2A: Enhanced Client Close Method**
- More aggressive EventSource termination
- ReadyState checks before operations
- Remove all event listeners properly

**Phase 2B: Improved Error Handler**
- Earlier exit in onerror handler
- Prevent close attempts on already-closed connections
- Better flag checking

Phase 2 fixes would modify `js/sse-client.js` on the client side.
