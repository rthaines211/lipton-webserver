## Database Integrity Checks

### Duplicate Check
```sql
SELECT option_name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM issue_options
GROUP BY option_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

Result: 0 rows (No duplicates)
```

### Orphaned Options Check
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM issue_options io
LEFT JOIN issue_categories ic ON io.category_id = ic.id
WHERE ic.id IS NULL;

Result: 0 (No orphaned options)
```

### Active Categories Count
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issue_categories WHERE is_active = true;

Result: 22 categories
```

### Active Options Count
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issue_options WHERE is_active = true;

Result: 221 options
```

---

## Files Modified

1. **Created:** [database/cleanup_taxonomy.sql](cleanup_taxonomy.sql) - Cleanup script
2. **Updated:** Database - Removed duplicates and aligned with form
3. **Created:** This audit report

---

## SQL Commands Used

### Cleanup Execution
```bash
psql legal_forms < database/cleanup_taxonomy.sql
```

### Verification Queries
```sql
-- Check duplicates
SELECT option_name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM issue_options
GROUP BY option_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- View category summary
SELECT ic.category_name, ic.display_order, COUNT(io.id) as option_count
FROM issue_categories ic
LEFT JOIN issue_options io ON ic.id = io.category_id
WHERE ic.is_active = true
GROUP BY ic.id, ic.category_name, ic.display_order
ORDER BY ic.display_order;

-- View specific category options
SELECT ic.category_name, array_agg(io.option_name ORDER BY io.display_order) as options
FROM issue_categories ic
LEFT JOIN issue_options io ON ic.id = io.category_id
WHERE ic.category_code = 'vermin'
GROUP BY ic.id, ic.category_name;
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Form Integration
The taxonomy is now perfectly aligned with the form output. When integrating:
- Use `category_code` for programmatic access
- Use `option_code` for issue selection keys
- Use `display_order` for UI rendering sequence

### 2. API Endpoints
Consider creating these endpoints:
```
GET /api/taxonomy/categories - Get all categories with nested options
GET /api/taxonomy/categories/:code - Get specific category
POST /api/cases/:id/issues - Bulk add issues using option_codes
```

### 3. Future Maintenance
- Always add new options via SQL with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- Use soft deletes (`is_active = false`) instead of DELETE
- Run duplicate checks after any manual data modifications
- Keep this audit report updated

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Taxonomy cleaned and aligned
2. ⏭️ Create API endpoints for taxonomy retrieval
3. ⏭️ Update form submission handler to use new taxonomy
4. ⏭️ Create data migration script for existing form submissions
5. ⏭️ Update form frontend to populate from database taxonomy
