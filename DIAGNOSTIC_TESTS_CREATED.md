# ✅ Diagnostic Test Suite Created

## 🎯 Summary

I've created a comprehensive diagnostic test suite to identify the root causes of your GCP SSE connection issues. The tests are **non-invasive** and run in the browser console without modifying your production code.

3. **RUN_ALL_TESTS.md** - Detailed instructions with examples and interpretation guide
4. **DIAGNOSTIC_SUMMARY.md** - Problem analysis and expected fixes

### 🧪 Test Scripts
5. **test-sse-reconnect-race.js** - Diagnose reconnection loop
6. **test-503-handling.js** - Diagnose 503 error handling

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Interactive Guide (Easiest)
```bash
open diagnostics/quick-start.html
```
Click buttons to copy test scripts, paste in browser console.

### Option 2: Manual (More Control)
1. Open your deployed Cloud Run app
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Copy a test script from `diagnostics/test-*.js`
4. Paste into console and press Enter
5. Follow instructions in console
6. Run report function (e.g., `getTestReport()`)
7. Copy output and share

### Option 3: Read First
Start with `diagnostics/DIAGNOSTIC_SUMMARY.md` to understand the issues.

## 🐛 Issues Being Diagnosed

| Issue | Symptom | Test File | Report Function |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **SSE Loop** | Repeating connect/disconnect | `test-sse-reconnect-race.js` | `getTestReport()` |
| **503 Errors** | Service unavailable on reconnect | `test-503-handling.js` | `get503Report()` |
| **undefined/undefined** | Progress state logs undefined | `test-progress-state-undefined.js` | `getProgressStateReport()` |
| **Handler Timing** | submitBtnHandlerAttached: false | `test-submit-handler-timing.js` | `getSubmitHandlerReport()` |

## 🔬 What the Tests Do

### Test 1: SSE Reconnection Race
**Tracks:**
- EventSource instance lifecycle
- Multiple connections for same job
- `connect()` calls after completion
- `clearReconnectTimeout()` effectiveness

**Detects:**
- Race between timeout callback and job completion
- Multiple active EventSource instances
- Lingering event handlers

---

### Test 2: 503 Error Handling
**Tracks:**
- EventSource error events
- Reconnection timing and delays
- Rapid retry patterns

**Detects:**
- Missing exponential backoff
- Immediate retries after 503s
- Incorrect retry interval calculation

---

### Test 3: Progress State undefined
**Tracks:**
- `saveJobState()` parameters
- `updateJobProgress()` parameters
- SSE event payloads
- LocalStorage state

**Detects:**
- Missing `current`/`total` in function calls
- Missing fields in SSE events
- Incorrect variable references
- State corruption

---

### Test 4: Submit Handler Timing
**Tracks:**
- DOM ready state changes
- Event listener attachment timing
- Form and button element availability
- Debug snapshot timing

**Detects:**
- Handler attached after debug snapshot
- Handler on wrong element
- Multiple handler attachments
- Timing issues

---

## 📊 What to Report Back

For each test, provide:

1. **Full Console Output**
   - Include all emoji-prefixed messages
   - Include timestamps
   - Include any error stack traces

2. **Report Function Output**
   - Tables and summaries
   - Problem indicators
   - Statistics

3. **Screenshots**
   - Console showing repeating pattern
   - Network tab showing EventSource connections
   - Any error messages

4. **Timing Information**
   - How many times loop repeats
   - Time between events
   - Duration of issues

---

## 🎓 Understanding the Results

### Good Signs ✅
- Single EventSource instance per job
- No `connect()` calls after completion
- Increasing delays between retries (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- `current` and `total` always defined
- Event listeners attached before use

### Bad Signs ❌
- Multiple EventSource instances
- `jobCompleted: true` but still connecting
- Rapid retries (< 500ms apart)
- `undefined/undefined` in logs
- Handler attached after snapshot

## 💡 Key Insight

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**How These Tests Work:**

These tests use **method interception** - wrapping existing functions to log their behavior without changing functionality. Think of it like putting a microphone on a phone call to record it without affecting the conversation.

**For example:**
```javascript
const original = window.saveJobState;
window.saveJobState = function(...args) {
    console.log('Called with:', args);  // Log it
    return original(...args);            // Still works normally
}
```

This means:
- ✅ **Safe** - No changes to your production code
- ✅ **Non-invasive** - Application functions normally
- ✅ **Informative** - Captures detailed behavior
- ✅ **Reversible** - Reload page to remove

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Run the tests** using quick-start.html or manually
2. **Collect outputs** from report functions
3. **Share results** - Copy console logs and screenshots
4. **Receive fixes** - I'll create targeted fixes based on confirmed issues

---

## 📋 Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Open the interactive guide
open diagnostics/quick-start.html

# 2. In your browser:
#    - Navigate to your deployed app
#    - Open console (F12)
#    - Click "Copy Test Script" for Test 1
#    - Paste in console, press Enter
#    - Submit a form
#    - Observe the output
#    - Run: getTestReport()
#    - Copy all console output

# 3. Repeat for other tests
# 4. Share all outputs
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: Scripts won't load?**
A: Open the .js files in a text editor and copy contents manually.

**Q: No output in console?**
A: Check console filters (show all message types), ensure app JavaScript loaded.

**Q: Tests interfere with each other?**
A: Reload page between tests for clean state.

**Q: Can't find report functions?**
A: Look for "✅ diagnostic test ready" message after pasting script.

## 📖 Detailed Documentation

- **Complete Instructions:** [diagnostics/RUN_ALL_TESTS.md](./diagnostics/RUN_ALL_TESTS.md)
- **Problem Analysis:** [diagnostics/DIAGNOSTIC_SUMMARY.md](./diagnostics/DIAGNOSTIC_SUMMARY.md)
- **Quick Reference:** [diagnostics/README.md](./diagnostics/README.md)

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After running these tests and sharing results, you'll receive:

1. ✅ **Confirmation** - Which issues are actually present
2. ✅ **Root Causes** - Exact locations and reasons
3. ✅ **Targeted Fixes** - Code changes for confirmed issues
4. ✅ **Test Plan** - How to verify fixes work

---

## 🔒 Important Notes

- Tests are **read-only** - they don't modify your application
- Tests are **client-side** - they run in the browser, not on the server
- Tests are **temporary** - reload the page to remove them
- Tests are **safe for production** - they won't break anything

---

## 📞 Ready to Start?

1. Open `diagnostics/quick-start.html` in your browser
2. Follow the instructions
3. Share the outputs

**Good luck with the diagnostics! 🔬**
