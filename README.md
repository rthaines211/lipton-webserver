# Legal Form Application

This application provides a comprehensive legal form for collecting plaintiff and defendant information, along with detailed issue tracking. The form generates structured output that matches a specific JSON format suitable for legal document processing.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Sections**: Add/remove multiple plaintiffs and defendants
- **Comprehensive Issue Tracking**: Detailed categories for housing, safety, and legal issues
- **Form Submitter Tracking**: Optional submitter name and email capture with notification opt-in
- **Review Before Submit**: Users can review their submission and make changes before finalizing
- **Structured Data Output**: Generates JSON output matching the goalOutput.md specification
- **At a Glance Summary**: Real-time case overview with filing details, party metadata, and household indicators
- **Accessible Accordions**: Repeatable sections and issue categories use aria-synced accordion controls with collapse-all shortcuts
- **Dual Storage System**: JSON files and PostgreSQL database storage
- **Dropbox Integration**: ✅ Automatic cloud backup with folder structure preservation - **ACTIVE IN PRODUCTION** (see [DROPBOX_SETUP_COMPLETE.md](DROPBOX_SETUP_COMPLETE.md))
- **REST API**: Backend API for managing form submissions
- **Automated Testing**: Playwright tests for form functionality

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Running Tests

The application includes comprehensive Playwright tests that verify form functionality and output structure.

#### Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

#### Run tests with browser visible:
```bash
npm run test:headed
```

#### Debug tests:
```bash
npm run test:debug
```

#### View test results:
```bash
npm run test:report
```

#### Run specific test files:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/simple-form-test.spec.js
```

## Application Workflow

1. **Fill Out Form**: Users complete the legal form with property, plaintiff, and defendant information
2. **Email Notification Modal**: After clicking submit, users are presented with an optional notification opt-in
   - Enter submitter name and email to receive notifications when documents are processed
   - Click "Skip & Submit" to submit anonymously (submitter_name='Anonymous', submitter_email='')
3. **Data Storage**: Form data is saved to both:
   - JSON file in the `data/` directory
   - PostgreSQL database with relational structure
4. **Success Confirmation**: Upon successful submission, users see a confirmation with their entry ID

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main form page
- `GET /review.html` - Review page for submission preview
- `GET /success` - Success confirmation page
- `POST /api/form-entries` - Submit form data
- `GET /api/form-entries` - List all form entries
- `GET /api/form-entries/:id` - Get specific form entry
- `PUT /api/form-entries/:id` - Update form entry
- `DELETE /api/form-entries/:id` - Delete form entry
- `DELETE /api/form-entries/clear-all` - Delete all entries
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

## Form Structure

The form collects:

1. **Property Information**: Address, city, state, ZIP code, filing details
2. **Plaintiff Details**: Name, type, age category, head of household status, comprehensive issue tracking
3. **Defendant Details**: Name, entity type, role (manager/owner)

## Output Format

The application transforms raw form data into a structured JSON format that includes:

- Form metadata
- Plaintiff details with comprehensive discovery information
- Defendant details
- Full address information
- Filing location details

### Example Output Structure

```json
{
  "Form": {
    "Id": "1",
    "InternalName": "AutoPopulationForm",
    "Name": "Auto-Population Form"
  },
  "PlaintiffDetails": [
    {
      "Id": "unique-id",
      "PlaintiffItemNumberName": {
        "First": "John",
        "Last": "Doe",
        "FirstAndLast": "John Doe"
      },
      "PlaintiffItemNumberType": "Individual",
      "PlaintiffItemNumberDiscovery": {
        "VerminIssue": false,
        "Vermin": [],
        "InsectIssues": false,
        "Insects": []
        // ... extensive issue tracking fields
      }
    }
  ],
  "DefendantDetails2": [
    {
      "Id": "unique-id",
      "DefendantItemNumberName": {
        "First": "Jane",
        "Last": "Smith",
        "FirstAndLast": "Jane Smith"
      },
      "DefendantItemNumberType": "LLC",
      "DefendantItemNumberManagerOwner": "Manager"
    }
  ],
  "Full_Address": {
    "Country": "United States",
    "CountryCode": "US"
    // ... complete address information
  }
}
```

## Data Storage

The application uses a dual storage system for comprehensive data management:

### JSON File Storage
- Form submissions are stored as JSON files in the `data/` directory
- Each submission gets a unique timestamp-based ID
- Files are named: `form-entry-{timestamp}-{random}.json`

### PostgreSQL Database Storage
The application stores data in the `legal_forms_db` PostgreSQL database with the following structure:

#### Cases Table
Stores case-level information including:
- Property address, city, state, zip code
- Filing location and county
- **submitter_name**: Name of person who submitted the form (defaults to 'Anonymous' if skipped)
- **submitter_email**: Email address for notifications (defaults to '' if skipped)
- Form metadata and raw payload

#### Parties Table
Stores plaintiff and defendant information:
- Full name, party type (plaintiff/defendant)
- Plaintiff-specific fields: type, age category, head of household
- Defendant-specific fields: entity type, role

#### Party Issue Selections Table
Tracks all issues selected by plaintiffs:
- Links parties to their selected issues (vermin, insects, environmental hazards, etc.)

### Viewing Database Data

To view submitter information from the database:
```bash
psql legal_forms_db -c "SELECT id, submitter_name, submitter_email, property_address, created_at FROM cases ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

For complete form submission details, see the SQL queries section in the project documentation.

## Dropbox Integration ✅ **ACTIVE**

The application **automatically uploads all generated legal documents to Dropbox** for cloud backup and storage. This feature is **fully operational** in both development and production (GCP Cloud Run).

**Production Status:** ✅ **Working** - Documents are automatically uploaded with folder creation and shared link generation.

### Quick Setup

1. Create a Dropbox app at [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
2. Generate an access token
3. Add to `.env` file:
   ```env
   DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   DROPBOX_ENABLED=true
   DROPBOX_BASE_PATH=/Apps/LegalFormApp
   ```
4. Test the integration:
   ```bash
   node test-dropbox-upload.js
   ```

### Features (All Working in Production)

- ✅ Automatic upload after document generation
- ✅ Preserves folder structure: `/Current Clients/[Address]/[Name]/Discovery Propounded/`
- ✅ Automatic folder creation in Dropbox
- ✅ Shared link generation for each case
- ✅ Non-blocking (doesn't delay form submission)
- ✅ Error resilient (continues if upload fails)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Long-lived access token (never expires)

- **Original Docs:** [docs/setup/DROPBOX_SETUP.md](docs/setup/DROPBOX_SETUP.md)

## Testing

The test suite includes:

1. **Form Loading Tests**: Verify all required form elements are present
2. **Form Submission Tests**: Test complete form workflow and data transformation
3. **Multi-Party Tests**: Verify adding multiple plaintiffs and defendants
4. **API Tests**: Validate backend endpoints and data structure
5. **Structure Validation**: Ensure output matches goalOutput.md specification

### Test Coverage

- Form element visibility and interaction
- Dynamic plaintiff/defendant addition
- Form validation and submission
- Data transformation accuracy
- API response validation
- Output structure compliance

### Form Field Naming Convention

- Property fields: `property-address`, `city`, `state`, etc.
- Plaintiff fields: `plaintiff-{number}-{field}` (e.g., `plaintiff-1-first-name`)
- Defendant fields: `defendant-{number}-{field}` (e.g., `defendant-1-entity`)
- Issue checkboxes: `{category}-{item}-{plaintiff-number}` (e.g., `vermin-RatsMice-1`)
