# Phase 2 Complete: Full Monitoring Stack Deployed on VM

✅ **Status:** COMPLETE
📅 **Completed:** October 23, 2025
⏱️ **Duration:** ~2 hours (including troubleshooting)

---

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully deployed a complete, production-ready monitoring stack on `docmosis-tornado-vm` consisting of:

1. **NGINX Prometheus Exporter** - Collecting NGINX metrics
2. **Prometheus** - Time-series metrics database with 7-day retention
3. **Grafana** - Visualization and dashboarding platform

All components are running in Docker containers with automatic restarts, health checks, and persistent storage.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. Automated Deployment Script

Created `setup-vm-monitoring.sh` that handles:
- ✅ Prerequisites validation
- ✅ Directory structure creation
- ✅ Configuration file deployment
- ✅ NGINX stub_status configuration
- ✅ Docker Compose installation (if needed)
- ✅ Container deployment and verification

### 2. NGINX Metrics Collection

Configured NGINX to expose metrics:
- **Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:8081/nginx_status
- **Access Control:** Restricted to localhost + Docker networks (`172.16.0.0/12`)
- **Metrics Exposed:**
  - Active connections
  - Request rate
  - Connection states (reading/writing/waiting)
  - Total requests served

### 3. Prometheus Deployment

Deployed Prometheus with:
- **Scrape Targets:**
  - `nginx` (15s interval) - NGINX metrics via exporter
  - `node-server` (30s interval) - Cloud Run Node.js service
  - `python-pipeline` (60s interval) - Cloud Run Python service
- **Storage:** 7-day local retention
- **Features:**
  - Lifecycle API enabled (config reload)
  - Admin API enabled (debugging)
  - Health checks configured

### 4. Grafana Deployment

Deployed Grafana with:
- **Auto-Provisioning:**
  - Prometheus datasource pre-configured
  - Dashboard provider enabled
  - No manual setup required
- **Access Method:** SSH tunnel for security
- **Version:** 12.2.1 (latest stable)
- **Plugins:** Auto-installed (Loki, Pyroscope, etc.)

### 5. Access Automation

Created `access-grafana.sh` script for easy access:
- One command to create SSH tunnel
- Tunnels both Grafana (3000) and Prometheus (9090)
- Clear instructions displayed on run

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue 1: Path Quoting in Bash Script
**Problem:** SCP failing with "No such file or directory" for paths with spaces
**Cause:** Bash variables not quoted when path contained "Lipton Webserver"
**Solution:** Added double quotes around all variable references: `"$VARIABLE"`

### Issue 2: Docker Compose Version Mismatch
**Problem:** Script detected docker-compose but command wasn't available
**Cause:** Detection logic checked for command existence but not executability
**Solution:**
- Improved detection to actually test execution
- Downloaded standalone binary (v2.24.0) from GitHub
- Added user to docker group
- Fixed docker socket permissions

### Issue 3: Distroless Container Healthchecks
**Problem:** nginx-exporter healthcheck failing, blocking Prometheus startup
**Cause:** Container is distroless (no shell, curl, or wget available)
**Solution:**
- Removed healthcheck from nginx-exporter
- Changed Prometheus dependency from `service_healthy` to `service_started`

### Issue 4: Deprecated Command Flags
**Problem:** nginx-exporter logs showed deprecation warnings
**Cause:** Using old single-dash flag format (`-nginx.scrape-uri`)
**Solution:** Updated to new double-dash format (`--nginx.scrape-uri`)

### Issue 5: Missing Port in Scrape URI
**Problem:** nginx-exporter couldn't connect to NGINX
**Cause:** URI was `http://host.docker.internal/nginx_status` (missing `:8081`)
**Solution:** Updated to `http://host.docker.internal:8081/nginx_status`

### Issue 6: NGINX Listen Address
**Problem:** Docker containers getting "connection refused" from NGINX
**Cause:** NGINX listening on `127.0.0.1:8081` (localhost only)
**Solution:** Changed to `0.0.0.0:8081` to accept connections from Docker bridge

### Issue 7: Docker Network Access Control
**Problem:** NGINX returning 403 Forbidden to nginx-exporter
**Cause:** Container on `172.18.0.2` (custom network), allow list only had `172.17.0.0/16` (default bridge)
**Solution:** Updated allow rule to `172.16.0.0/12` (covers all Docker networks)

## 🎨 How to Use

### Access Grafana

**Quick Method:**
```bash
cd monitoring/gcp/scripts
./access-grafana.sh
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:3000**
Login: `admin` / `tornado2025!`

**Manual Method:**
```bash
gcloud compute ssh docmosis-tornado-vm \
  --zone=us-central1-c \
  --project=docmosis-tornado \
  --ssh-flag='-L 3000:localhost:3000 -L 9090:localhost:9090 -N'
```

### Import Pre-Built Dashboard

1. In Grafana, go to **Dashboards** → **New** → **Import**
2. Enter Dashboard ID: **12708** (NGINX Prometheus Exporter)
3. Select **Prometheus** as datasource
4. Click **Import**

Instantly see:
- Request rate graphs
- Active connection gauges
- Response time trends
- Connection state breakdown

### Create Custom Dashboard

Use these PromQL queries:

**Active Connections:**
```promql
nginx_connections_active
```

**Requests Per Second:**
```promql
rate(nginx_http_requests_total[5m])
```

**Connection States:**
```promql
nginx_connections_reading
nginx_connections_writing
nginx_connections_waiting
```

## 💰 Cost Impact

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Existing VM | $25/month (already paid) |
| Additional RAM used | ~310MB (well within capacity) |
| Additional Disk used | ~2GB (Docker volumes) |
| Additional Storage cost | $0.10/month |
| **Total New Cost** | **$0.10/month** ✅ |

The monitoring stack adds negligible cost while providing comprehensive visibility.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Distroless Containers:** Modern security-focused images don't include shells or utilities, requiring different healthcheck strategies

2. **Docker Networking:** Custom Docker networks get different subnets than the default bridge; use broader CIDR ranges (`/12`) to cover all networks

3. **NGINX Listen Directives:** `127.0.0.1` vs `0.0.0.0` matters for containerized applications accessing host services

4. **Bash Path Handling:** Always quote variables containing paths, especially when spaces are possible

5. **Docker Compose Versions:** The transition from standalone binary to plugin causes compatibility issues; standalone binary is more reliable for automation

### Process Improvements

1. **Test-First Approach:** Better to test individual components (NGINX, exporter, Prometheus) before integrating

2. **Incremental Deployment:** Deploy and verify each service before adding the next (nginx-exporter → Prometheus → Grafana)

3. **Comprehensive Error Logging:** Always check logs when troubleshooting: `docker-compose logs <service>`

4. **Network Debugging:** Use `ss -tlnp`, `curl`, and `docker network inspect` to diagnose connectivity

## 🚦 Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)
1. **Import More Dashboards**
   - Cloud Run metrics dashboard
   - System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Custom application dashboards

2. **Set Up Alerts**
   - High connection count (> threshold)
   - Elevated error rates
   - Service downtime
   - Response time degradation

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Change default Grafana password
   - Enable HTTPS for production use
   - Set up user accounts and permissions
   - Configure authentication (OAuth, LDAP, etc.)

### Future Phases (As Needed)
1. **Phase 3: Google Managed Prometheus**
   - Configure remote_write
   - Long-term metric storage (> 7 days)
   - Cross-service querying
   - Enterprise alerting

2. **Phase 4: Advanced Dashboards**
   - Custom application metrics
   - Business metrics (form conversions, etc.)
   - SLO/SLA tracking
   - Cost monitoring dashboards

3. **Phase 5: Alerting & Notifications**
   - Grafana alert rules
   - Notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
   - On-call rotation setup
   - Incident response playbooks
