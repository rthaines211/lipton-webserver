## ðŸ§© Feature: Save Generated Documents to Dropbox (Preserve Folder Structure)

### Current Behavior
When the web app generates documents, they are saved **locally** on the server using a defined folder hierarchy.

Example:

    /output/
     â”œâ”€â”€ Clients/
     â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ SmithCase/
     â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ SROGs/
     â”‚    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ PODs/
     â”‚    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Admissions/
     â”‚    â””â”€â”€ DoeCase/
     â””â”€â”€ Templates/

All generated files currently remain on the local file system (for example: `/output/...`).

---

### Desired Behavior
- Instead of saving locally, the generated documents should be **uploaded to Dropbox**.  
- The **parent folder** (top-level directory under Dropbox) will **always remain the same** (e.g., `/Apps/MyWebApp/` or `/Clients/`).  
- The **sub-folder structure** should **mirror exactly** what the app currently generates locally.

Example:

If a document is generated at:  
`/output/Clients/SmithCase/SROGs/Set1.docx`

â€¦it should appear in Dropbox as:  
`/Apps/MyWebApp/Clients/SmithCase/SROGs/Set1.docx`

---

### Technical Notes
- Use the **Dropbox API (Scoped App)** for file uploads.  
- Keep the existing logic that builds folder paths â€” only change the **destination** from local disk to Dropbox.  
- The parent Dropbox folder path should be configurable via an environment variable (e.g., `DROPBOX_BASE_PATH`).  
- Automatically create any missing sub-folders in Dropbox before uploading.  
- Overwrite existing files if they already exist.  
- The implementation must work both **locally** and **in a cloud-deployed environment** (no reliance on persistent local storage).  

---

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documents upload to the correct Dropbox folder, preserving sub-folder structure.  
- [ ] Local generation paths remain unchanged (for backward compatibility).  
- [ ] Dropbox path uses the same relative structure under the configured base folder.  
- [ ] Code is **cloud-ready** (stateless, configurable via environment variables).  
- [ ] Logging includes both **local** and **Dropbox** paths for traceability.
