- [ ] Monitor console for progress messages

**Expected Console Output:**
```
üìä Progress update for [case-id]: {current: 1, total: 4, message: "..."}
üìä Progress update for [case-id]: {current: 2, total: 4, message: "..."}
üìä Progress update for [case-id]: {current: 3, total: 4, message: "..."}

**Expected Console Output:**
```
‚úÖ Job completed for [case-id]: {total: 4, outputUrl: "..."}
üîå Closing SSE connection for [case-id]
```

**Verification:**

## 3. Error Handling üî¥

### Test 3.1: Network Error Simulation
- [ ] Submit a form

  - Firefox: Network tab ‚Üí Throttling ‚Üí "Offline"
- [ ] Wait 10-15 seconds
- [ ] Re-enable network

**Expected Behavior:**
```
Console Output:
‚ùå SSE connection error for [case-id]
üîÑ Reconnecting in 1000ms (attempt 1/6)
üîÑ Reconnecting in 2000ms (attempt 2/6)
‚úÖ SSE connection opened for [case-id]
üìä Progress update... (resumes)
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] No error toast appears (toasts removed)
- [ ] Console shows reconnection attempts
- [ ] Connection re-establishes automatically
- [ ] Progress resumes after reconnection
- [ ] No JavaScript errors or crashes

### Test 3.2: Invalid Form Data
- [ ] Enter invalid email format in notification email field
- [ ] Click "Submit"
- [ ] **Expected:** Browser alert shows "Please enter a valid email address"
- [ ] **Expected:** Form does not submit
- [ ] Correct the email and resubmit
- [ ] **Expected:** Submission succeeds

### Test 3.3: Server Error Simulation
- [ ] Temporarily stop the backend server:
  ```bash
  # Find Node process
  lsof -ti:8080
  # Kill process
  kill [PID]
  ```
- [ ] Try to submit a form
- [ ] **Expected:** Form shows error alert after timeout
- [ ] Restart server and resubmit
- [ ] **Expected:** Submission succeeds

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check build output
ls -la dist/js/
# Should NOT contain toast-notifications.js

# Check dist/index.html
grep -i "notyf" dist/index.html
# Should return NO results (empty output)
```

### Test 4.2: Minified Files
- [ ] Check dist/js/sse-client.js

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

After deploying to production, monitor for:

1. **User Feedback**
   - [ ] Users report confusion about submission status
   - [ ] Users ask about progress indicators
   - [ ] Users report submission failures

2. **Error Rates**
   - [ ] Check server error logs for increased failures
   - [ ] Monitor client-side JavaScript errors
   - [ ] Track form submission success rate

3. **Server Metrics**
   - [ ] SSE connection rate unchanged
   - [ ] Document generation success rate unchanged
   - [ ] API response times unchanged

**Recommendation:** Consider adding alternative user feedback mechanism if user confusion occurs (e.g., simple inline status messages or console notifications).
